# lorapacket
Simple LoRaWAN Packet Generator

Utilising elements from LMIC (https://github.com/matthijskooijman/arduino-lmic), this library encodes packets ready to send using a LoRa capable radio, such as the RFM95W.

## Prerequisites:

If you wish to use a RFM95W or similar radio, make sure to have the `arduino-LoRa` library installed.
