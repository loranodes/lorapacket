# lorapacket
Simple LoRaWAN Packet Generator

Utilising elements from [SemTech's LoRaWAN library](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-os/tree/master/features/lorawan/lorastack/mac), this library encodes LoRaWAN packets ready for sending using the radio of your choice.

## Prerequisites:

If you wish to use a RFM95W or similar radio, make sure to have the `arduino-LoRa` library installed.
